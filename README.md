# Z.Js
A simple almost html based js framework!

## Why?

We needed something very simple but can make a plain html, css and js project have a modern like developer experience and be scalable and yet has the power of single page applications (SPAs) or nay to say, react applications. Nothing fancy, just the bare minimum, we capitalize on intuitve architecture, native web platform features and principles instead of a bunch of libs, meta frameworks etc that devs are not familiar with!!!

## How it works?
