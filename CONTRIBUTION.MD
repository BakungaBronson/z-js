# This is how  this works in a nutshell

You clone this repository, look around the markdown files around different directories in project, most include what's included and what is missing yet, you can start from there or read the readme.md file with overview of the framework roadmap on a high level.

Once you done picking something you would like to work on, do it, create a branch off main branch, push to it and then make a pull request, we will review it in no time and merge it in if it's ok, and that's it.

Except z.js file and a few others, most files have where they belong in subsquent project directories so don't mind some redudant files in some directories for now, most will be removed soon, especially those in experiments!

with that said, welcome on board, just keep an eye on how we naming things and how project's structured, we quite want to stay consistent, thank you!

Am Kizz by the way, nice to have you interested in this!
